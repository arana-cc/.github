## **Hi there 👋**

Welcome to **arana.cc**.

We are building a next-generation routing and community platform for cyclists, focusing on highly personalized route generation.

### **🕸️ What is Arana?**

**Arana** (Spanish for *spider*) represents the core of our routing logic. Just as Dijkstra's algorithm explores nodes in a graph like a spider weaving a web, our engine analyzes thousands of street segments to find the perfect path for your ride.

The **.cc** stands for *Cycling Club*, positioning us alongside modern cycling culture brands.

### **🛠️ Tech Stack**

We are building a high-performance, scalable architecture using:

* **Frontend:** Next.js (SSR), React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.  
* **Mobile:** React Native, MapLibre Native.  
* **Routing Engine:** GraphHopper (Java) running on Hetzner.  
* **Microservices:** FastAPI (Python) for personalized weight calculation and custom models.  
* **Data & Auth:** Supabase (PostgreSQL).  
* **Mapping:** MapLibre GL JS (Vector Tiles).

### **🚀 Our Mission**

To move beyond generic "fastest path" routing. We use granular segment ratings and personalized user profiles to calculate routes that tailored to the specific rider's preference.

*Ride far, ride safe.*
